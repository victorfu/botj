## Google Cloud Storage of Files
The file uploading function is supported by Google Cloud Storage (GCS). First, make sure a 
GCS bucket ready to store files and put the bucket name in the environment variable `FILE_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`. 
Second, the Google credentials is used to access the GCS bucket. Please name the Google credentials 
(i.e., the json file downloaded from Google cloud console) as `file-storage.json` and put it in the root folder.
The two environment variables `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and `FILE_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` are necessary. 
The `FILE_STORAGE_ENABLED` environment variable is used to turn on/off the file uploading function.
By default, file uploading is disabled. The corresponding api will return http error code 404.

environment variable is used to enable/disable Redis. By default, Redis is disabled.
